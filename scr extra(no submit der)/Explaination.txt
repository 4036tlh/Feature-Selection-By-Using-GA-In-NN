population size = 40
gene size	= 60
mutation probability  = 0.8
crossover probability = 0.2
number of generation  = 30

fitness = validation accuracy from NN model(99% weight) + number of selected attributes(1% weight) 
(best:1, worst:0)

Fitness = 0.99*A + 0.01*(60-N)/59   best= 1 , worst = 0 , thersold = 0.8314
A = Accuracy
N = Number of selected attributes

thersold(the validation accuracy with all 60 attributes involve) = 0.831


Process:

1- Initialize 	
	|-initializePopulation() === produce 10 chromosome in random

2- Evaluation
	|-evaluateChromosome() === run cal_fitness() & get the fitness from "result.txt"
		|-cal_fitness() === run saveIntoFile() & run 'NN.py' to calculate the fitness
			|	=== the fitness will be store in "result.txt"
			|	* A text file called "history.txt"is used to store the chromosome ID and their fitness
			|	* Hence we don't need to wasting time on calculating it again
			|	* The ID is the decimal form of the 60 bits-binary number(the code of the chromosome)
			|-saveIntoFile() === save the chromosomes into "gene.txt"

3- Record
	|-record() === record the best fitness, average fitness & best chromosome into 3 txt
		|-calcAvgFitness() === calculate the average and record inside c++
		|-findBestFitness() === find best fitness and record inside c++
	Save into txt :
		-avgFitnessFile
		-bestChromosomeFile
		-bestFitnessFile
	*The record is prepare for plotting out the graph

4- Parent selection	(tournament selection with size 2)
	|-parentSelection() === select 2 parents from the last generation chromosomes

5- Crossover	(2-point crossover)
	|-crossover()

6- Mutation	(2-point mutation)
	|-mutation() 

7- Survival selection
	|-survivalSelection() === transfer the new children into newChromosome
	|-copyChromosome() === transfer the newChromosome into chromosomes
	*newChromosome is just a temp

8- run 'plot_graph.py' to plot the graph

For every generation, step 2,3,4,5,6,7 will repeat 5 times
every times will produce 2 new chromosome, lastly will have 10 new chromosomes
and finally replace all the old chromosomes with the new 10
